That moment felt very happy. ✨\n\nThat day, we spent just a little time together, but I got to know you as someone so kind, mature, positive, beautiful, and someone who understands — really understands. 🌸\n\nAfter meeting again, I felt it even more deeply — you’re not just a beautiful soul. \nYou’re a kind, cute, and generous friend — someone who makes time fly when we’re together ☺ and I truly enjoy every moment with you. 🤗\n\nWhen we talk, it feels like home. 🥰\nThe moments we share become unforgettable — full of laughter, shared secrets, and good vibes all around.\n\nEvery time I meet you, I feel a wave of positivity. ✨\n\nOn your birthday, I truly wish that every burden in your life gets lifted, every problem disappears like it never existed. \nMay you be the happiest person in the world. 🥳💖\n\nAnd please — if you ever need anything from me or if there's anything I can do — just ask. (If you ask, I’ll be happier than you!) \nYou can trust me, and I’ll do my best to never break your trust.",
