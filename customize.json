  "textInChatBox": "Since talking for ages to finally meeting on 6th May 2025… (It's very special) ❤ You know — some friendships aren’t made, they’re found. 🫶🏻 Unexpectedly, slowly, but deeply. Maybe… the best friendships begin when two souls recognize each other before they even meet. 💫We had been talking for years, but when we finally met — we truly got to know each other. That moment felt very happy. ✨That day, we spent just a little time together, but I got to know you as someone so kind, mature, positive, beautiful, and someone who understands — really understands. 🌸 After meeting again, I felt it even more deeply — you’re not just a beautiful soul. You’re a kind, cute, and generous friend — someone who makes time fly when we’re together ☺ and I truly enjoy every moment with you. 🤗When we talk, it feels like home. 🥰The moments we share become unforgettable — full of laughter, shared secrets, and good vibes all around.Every time I meet you, I feel a wave of positivity. ✨On your birthday, I truly wish that every burden in your life gets lifted, every problem disappears like it never existed. May you be the happiest person in the world. 🥳💖And please — if you ever need anything from me or if there's anything I can do — just ask. (If you ask, I’ll be happier than you!)You can trust me, and I’ll do my best to never break your trust.",
