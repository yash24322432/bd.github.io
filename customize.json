Maybe… the best friendships begin when two souls recognize each other before they even meet. 💫We had been talking for years, but when we finally met — we truly got to know each other. That moment felt really happy. ✨That day, we spent just a little time together, but I got to know you as someone so kind, mature, positive, beautiful — and someone who understands. 🌸After meeting again, I felt it even more deeply — you’re not just a beautiful soul.You’re a kind, cute, and generous friend — someone who makes time fly when we’re together ☺️ And I enjoy so much whenever I meet you 🤗When we talk, it feels like home. 🥰The moments we share become unforgettable — full of laughter, shared secrets, and good vibes all around.Every time I meet you, I feel a wave of positivity. ✨On your birthday, I truly wish that every burden in your life gets lifted, every problem disappears like it never existed.May you be the happiest person in the world. 🥳💖And please — if you ever need anything from me, or anything I can do — just ask. (If you ask, I’ll be happier than you.) You can trust me, and I’ll do my best to never break that trust. 💫And I wish you become the world’s best interior designer — charging ₹24 crore per square foot 😄 (Mera ghar bhi aap hi design karoge — vo bhi free mein) 😚And that you travel to every dream destination (many places with me 🤣)…and of course, may you find your young Korean husband (like Yang Gwan-sik 😅)Someone who makes you laugh, brings you peace, takes care of you always, loves you, and also gives you tangerines 🥰😂Lastly… nothing is bigger than staying positive. 🌟Just believe in God — everything will happen for the good. 🙌I pray life brings you happiness, peace, and endless smiles. ❤",
